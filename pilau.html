        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Saut√© for a minute until the spices become fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook until it turns golden brown, stirring occasionally. This should take around 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>If using meat, add the chicken or beef pieces to the pot and cook until browned on all sides. If not using meat, skip to the next step.</li>
            <li>Add the turmeric powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, and paprika to the pot. Mix well to coat the meat or onions with the spices.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot. Stir well to coat the rice with the onion and spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water or chicken/beef broth and season with salt according to your taste. Bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. If using meat, ensure it is cooked through and tender.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. This will allow the steam to finish cooking the rice and make it fluffy.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice gently with a fork.</li>
            <li>Serve the Kenyan-style pilau hot, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves if desired. Squeeze some lemon juice over the pilau for added freshness and tanginess.</li>
